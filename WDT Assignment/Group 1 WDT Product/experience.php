            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>After my IGSE O levels, I wanted to get some experience in working in an office so I started working at a young age. I worked as a sales assistant, assistant sales manager and also in customer care. Throughout the 4 years that i was working, I've learned several things such as being able to work in a busy enviroment, being able to work overtime and also how to deal with customers and customer complaints and many more. Later i wanted to pursue my studies so i joined APU to do my diploma in coding. </p>
